- # Important
	- Simple math: **each login costs money** (because of phone number verification) => minimize overall re-logins. For example at server restart => implement login state that **persists** (don't forget logged in users at server restart)
	-
- # Steps
	- 1) user starts the login process
	- 2) user enters login data (username, password)
	- 3) if login data is correct: user verifies his phone number
	- 4) if phone number verification successful: user is logged in
- # Process vulnerabilities and counter actions
	- ## Inputs of the clumsy user
		- Wrong username => Try to fetch user and his password(-hash) by username
		- Wrong password => Compare password-hashes
		- Wrong verification code => retry verification
	- ## Actions of the clumsy user
		- Abort login mid-process => reset/re-init login at next attempt
	- ## Inputs of the evil user
		- SQL-Injection => backend of JPA uses prepared statements
		- Log-Injection => ^^Do not log unverified user input^^
	- ## Actions of the evil user
		- TODO brute force usernames and passwords
		- Repeat verification process infinite times => restrict attempts per time (**Verification Block**)
			- e.g. limit of 3 attempts. User will be blocked for 5mins after those
		- Bypass verification block by restarting (=resetting) statefulRegistrationBean process => keep statefulRegistrationBean object in session and check if process restart/reset is allowed
