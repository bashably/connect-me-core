- see [[Registration Process]] for rules and further explaination
- # Initialize or reset registration is session (Step 1)
	- POST `/users/registration/init`
	- No payload, just call
	- ### Responses
		- `OK` => Success
		- `FORBIDDEN` => You are not allowed to reset or init a new registration {{cloze maybe there is a failed or still pending verification}}
	- ### Actions
		- If there is no registration currently in session, create one.
		- if there is already a registration in session, try to abort and reset it.
	- ### Patched Vulnerabilities
		- reset/re-init `StatefulRegistrationBean` in session when not allowed (e.g. while in [verification block](((62542000-13cc-4331-be2f-931eab1c896c))) ) => Check if reset allowed
- # Set user data (Step 2)
	- POST `/users/registration/set/userdata`
	- ### Payload
		- user data in `application/json` format
		- ```json
		  {
		    "username": "myusename",
		    "password": "clear-text-password",
		    "phoneNumber": "0 000 00000"
		  }
		  ```
	- ### Responses
		- `OK` => Data checked and seccessfully set
		- `BAD REQUEST` => Payload data in invalid or tests have failed {{cloze username not allowed, password too weak, invalid phone number, ...}}
		- `CONFLICT` => Username already exists OR phone number is already taken
		- `FORBIDDEN` => This interaction is not allowed in this registration step
	- ### Actions
		- Check all passed values and store them in session for later verification
	- ### Patched Vulnerabilities
		- pass invalid/malicious/unacceptable user data => input check/verification
		- set user data again after verification process => check state
		- TODO payload too _heavy_ => Restrict content size of HTTP request
- # Start verification process (Step 3)
	- POST `/users/registration/start/verify`
	- No payload, just call
	- ### Responses
		- `OK` => Success, verification code has been sent to the passed number
		- `FORBIDDEN` => You are currently not allowed to start the verification process {{cloze maybe the user exceeded the verification attempt limit and has to wait for a few minutes.}}
	- ### Actions
		- Generate Verification code and store it in session
		- Wait for verification code passed by user
	- ### Patched Vulerabilities
		- start verification process even though it's not allowed => check if another verification attempt is allowed
- # Send verification code (Step 4)
	- POST `/users/registration/verify`
	- ### Payload
		- verification code in `text/plain` format
	- ### Responses
		- `OK` => Success, user passed correct code and is now verified
		- `FORBIDDEN` => This interaction is not allowed in this registration step
		- `BAD_REQUEST` => Verification failed {{cloze user passed wrong verification code}}
	- ### Actions
		- Check if passed verification code equals actual verification code
			- Yes: Create user object from registration and persist it
			- No: increase failed attempt counter and return to Step 2 {{cloze the user has to call Step 3 (start verification process) and try again}} (see process documentation)

		- TODO payload too _heavy_ => Restrict content size of HTTP request
	-
